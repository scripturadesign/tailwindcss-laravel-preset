This is my Laravel preset to quickly get up and running in a new project
using [Tailwind CSS][link-tailwind]. The main part of this is
the templates I've redesigned using Tailwind.

I have "stolen" a few things from a few different presets I've looked at
and customised it to my preference.

And run the preset script using:

I'm open to suggestions, but this is mainly made for my own usage so it might be a bit opinionated.
