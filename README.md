# Tailwindcss preset for Laravel >5.5

This is my Laravel preset to quickly get up and running in a new project
using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The main part of this is
the templates I've redesigned using Tailwind.

I have "stolen" a few things from a few different presets I've looked at
and customised it to my preference.
